The dataset contained HR data regarding employees attrition.

Attrition is defined as both the voluntary and involuntary reduction of a companyâ€™s workforce through deaths, employee retirements, transfers, resignations and terminations. While some attrition is to be expected in normal business operations, a high level of reduction can lead to problems and a lack of manpower that's why it's important to keep track of your company's attrition rate.

My Dashboard shows: 
- The percentage of attrition during current year
- whether the overtime which employees takes can affect on the percentage of attrition
- perfomance for each job role
- the department which has the highest percentage of attriton and drilling down to know which job role and education field come from
- the avg salaries for all current employees
